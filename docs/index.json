Encapsulating a plethora of potential use cases—from logistics-based packing problems to human-robot service settings—the interactions between a robot and its environment are often difficult to plan and execute precisely, as there will always be some degree of uncertainty in the model of the robot or its environment. This uncertainty has historically elicited conflict within the robot’s internal control schema, as it required both positions and forces of the actuators to be balanced appropriately as to satisfy task requirements. System compliance—either in a software-based or a hardware-based solution—has been largely the key to enabling a robot to overcome such environmental or system-modeling uncertainties. This inherent adaptability in the robot’s kinematic structure can generally simplify planning and control of the robot, which has in turn enabled fundamental advancements in robot manipulation. In this workshop, we will explore the state-of-the in compliance-enabled robot manipulation on numerous fronts. Panelists and speakers will discuss how compliance, and other similar paradigms, have changed formulations and processes for planning, control, design, sensing, learning, optimization, etc. for such robot systems. ","date":1683723600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683723600,"objectID":"a8edef490afe42206247b6ac05657af0","permalink":"https://vector-wangel.github.io/wowchemy_website/event/example/","publishdate":"2023-05-19T18:50:24.126Z","relpermalink":"/wowchemy_website/event/example/","section":"event","summary":"ICRA workshop","tags":[],"title":"\"Compliant Robot Manipulation: Challenges and New Opportunities\" Workshop","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rThe Texas Regional Robotics Symposium (TEROS) aims to bring together Texas robotics researchers.

Instead of explicitly modeling the contacts and dynamics in manipulation, we can calculate a map to describe the energy states of different hand-object configurations under an actuation input. Since the system intrinsically steers towards low energy states, the object's movement is uniquely described by the gradient of the energy map if the corresponding actuation is applied. Such maps are pre-calculated for a range of actuation inputs to represent the system's energy profile. We discretize the workspace into a grid and construct an energy gradient-based graph by locally exploring the gradients of the stored energy profile. Given a goal configuration of a simple cylindrical object, a sequence of actuation inputs can be calculated to manipulate it towards the goal by exploiting the connectivity in the graph. The proposed approach is experimentally implemented on a Yale T42 hand. Our evaluation results show that parts of the graph are well-connected, explaining our ability to successfully plan and execute trajectories within the gripper's workspace.","tags":[],"title":"Energy Gradient-Based Graphs for Planning Within-Hand Caging Manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaiyu Hang","Andrew S.

To maximize the contact areas for achieving more robust grasps, we first define the concept of a Contact Primitive, which represents a set of contacts with similar local geometries. Thereafter, we propose a uniform cost algorithm, formulated as a decision-making process in a tree structure, to cluster a set of example grasp contacts into a finite set of Contact Primitives. We design fingertips by optimization to match the local geometry of each contact primitive, and then 3D print them using soft materials to compensate for optimization residuals. For novel objects, we provide an efficient algorithm to generate grasp contacts that match the fingertip geometries while forming stable grasps. Comparing to a baseline of flat fingertip design, the experimental results show that our design significantly improves grasp stability and is more robust against various uncertainties.","tags":[],"title":"Fingertip Surface Optimization for Robust Grasping on Contact Primitives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weihao Yuan","Johannes A.

Usually, this is achieved by precisely modeling the physical properties of the objects, robot, and environment for explicit planning. In contrast, explicitly modeling the physical environment is not always feasible and involves various uncertainties. Therefore, we learn a nonprehensile rearrangement strategy with deep reinforcement learning based on only visual feedback. To do this, we model the task with rewards and train a deep Q-network. Our potential field-based heuristic exploration strategy reduces the number of collisions that lead to suboptimal outcomes, and we actively balance the training set to avoid bias towards poor examples. Our training process leads to quicker learning and better performance on the task compared to uniform exploration and standard experience replay. We demonstrate empirical evidence from simulation that our method leads to a success rate of 85%. We also show that our system can cope with sudden changes in the environment and compare our performance with human-level performance.","tags":[],"title":"Rearrangement with Nonprehensile Manipulation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silvia Cruciani","Christian Smith","Danica Kragic","Kaiyu Hang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata.

Such underactuated hands are able to passively achieve stable contacts with objects. Combined with vision-based control and data-driven state estimation processes, they can solve tasks without accurate hand-object models or multimodal sensory feedback. In particular, a data-driven regression process is used here to estimate the probability of dropping the object for given manipulation states. Then, an optimization-based planner aims to track the desired path while avoiding states that are above a threshold probability of dropping the object. The optimized cost function, based on the principle of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), seeks to minimize the area between the desired and the followed path. By adapting the threshold for the probability of dropping the object, the framework can handle objects of different weights without retraining. Experiments involving writing letters with a marker, as well as tracing randomized paths, were conducted on the Yale Model T-42 hand.

To achieve this, we introduce and formally characterize search space structure and cost functions, under which minimal cost paths correspond to optimal grasps. Our formulation avoids expensive exhaustive search and reduces computational cost by several orders of magnitude. We present admissible heuristic functions and exploit approximate heuristic search to further reduce computational cost while maintaining bounded sub-optimality for resulting grasps.\n\nWe exemplify our formulation with point-contact grasping, for which we define domain-specific heuristics and demonstrate optimality and bounded sub-optimality by comparing against exhaustive and uniform cost search on example objects.

We model the interaction between the herders and the sheep by assuming that the former exert virtual \"repulsive forces\" that push the sheep away from them. These forces induce a potential field in which the sheep move in a way that does not increase their potential. This enables the robots to partially control the motion of the sheep. We formalize this behavior geometrically by applying the notion of caging, which is widely used in robotic grasping.

During execution, the system plans and executes fingertip grasps using Canny's grasp quality metric and a learned random forest-based hand reachability heuristic. In the offline module, this heuristic is improved based on a grasping manifold that is incrementally learned from the experiences collected during execution. The system is evaluated both in simulation and on a SchunkSDH dexterous hand mounted on a KUKA-KR5 arm. We show that, as the grasping manifold is adapted to the system's experiences, the heuristic becomes more accurate, resulting in improved performance of the execution module.
