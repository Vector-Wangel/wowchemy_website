However, I will carefully read every application once you submit to the Rice system. <br>_Projects for Undergraduate and Master Students_: Research projects for Undergraduate and Master students are available. If you are a Rice student and interested in working in my lab, please send me an email with your CV and transcripts. The minimum training time is 6 months.
