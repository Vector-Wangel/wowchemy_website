summary: We propose an anytime algorithm to plan the placement of a rigid object
  with a dual-arm robot in a cluttered environment. The algorithm integrates
  sampling-based motion planning with a novel hierarchical search for suitable
  placement poses, incrementally producing approach motions to stable placement
  poses and reaching placements with better objectives as runtime progresses.
  Our approach is effective for two different placement objectives, even in
  challenging scenarios.
