abstract: We propose the Dexterous Manipulation Graph as a tool to address
  in-hand manipulation and reposition an object inside a robot's end-effector.
  This graph is used to plan a sequence of manipulation primitives to bring the
  object to the desired end pose. This sequence of primitives is translated into
  motions of the robot to move the object held by the end-effector. We use a
  dual-arm robot with parallel grippers to test our method on a real system and
  show successful planning and execution of in-hand manipulation.
