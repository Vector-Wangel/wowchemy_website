summary:  Building hand-object models for dexterous inhand manipulation remains a crucial and open problem. Major
challenges include the difficulty of obtaining the geometric
and dynamical models of the hand, object, and time-varying
contacts, as well as the inevitable physical and perception
uncertainties. Instead of building accurate models to map
between the actuation inputs and the object motions, this work
proposes to enable the hand-object systems to continuously
approximate their local models via a self-identification process
where an underlying manipulation model is estimated through
a small number of exploratory actions and non-parametric
learning.
